  "content": "Sometime really late last night I heard a bunch of people outside my apartment. It was suuuuper loud, like it sounded like hundreds of people yelling and talking and hitting things. It went on for a couple minutes and I just tried to ignore it and go back to sleep. I was just about to give up and go look outside when it all went so quiet. When I got to the window, there wasn't anyone in sight. It really freaked me out but I tried to go back to sleep again. My alarm woke me up at my usual time but... it's still dark outside. It looks like it's 3am outside still even though all my clocks say it's already 9:30am. I'm afraid to go outside because it's so dark and spooky but maybe it's just some daylight savings thing. I texted my parents a few minutes ago and haven't heard from anyone yet, and I don't think I've heard anyone starting their car or opening the gate all morning. I don't know what is going on but I'm really, really worried.",
